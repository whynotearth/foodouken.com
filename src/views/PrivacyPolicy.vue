        <br />
        <p>
          If you are a visitor located in the European Economic Area ("EEA"),

        <br />
        <p>
          Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information
          described above will depend on the personal information concerned and
          the specific context in which we collect it. However, we will normally
          collect personal information from you only where we have your consent
          to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract
          with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and
          not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights
          and freedoms. In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to
          collect personal information from you.

        <br />
        <p>
          If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal
          requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear
          at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your

          on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will
          make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests
          are.
